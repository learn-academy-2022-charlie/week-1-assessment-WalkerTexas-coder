# ASSESSMENT 1: Tech Interview Practice Questions
Answer the following questions.

First, without external resources. Challenge yourself to answer from memory as if you were in a job interview. If you don't know the answer a good tip is to answer a simpler version of the question.

Then, research the question to expand on your answer. Even if you feel you have answered the question completely, there is always something more to learn. Write your researched answer in your OWN WORDS.

INSTRUCTOR EXAMPLE: What is a conditional statement?

  Your answer: I used a conditional statement this last week in class to create a decision tree that figured out if someone was old enough to drink and to vote. My understanding is that all conditional statements in JavaScript start with if, and ends with else. They also allow for else if. 

  Researched answer: Conditional statements check evaluations using true boolean values to determine which code block to activate. Conditionals do not require an else statement but always require an if statement.
